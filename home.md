### Why Lazysodium?

The problem with current cryptography libraries is that they can be one of 4 things: difficult to use, poorly documented, out of date or poorly architected.

So we built Lazysodium to make it **absolutely effortless** to get started with cryptography. We picked [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) `1.0.16` as our underlying C library. Libsodium is an immensely powerful, well-tested and well-audited cryptography library that we found was perfect for securing all types of things.

### Supported languages
