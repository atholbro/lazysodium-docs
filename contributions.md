# Contributions

##  Introduction

All contributions are appreciated and very welcome. There are many forms that contributions could take.

1. Issues and suggestions.
2. Code contributions.
3. Promoting Lazysodium.

##  Issues and suggestions

### Found an issue

Report these immediately on the issue tracker. If it's a very dangerous bug, then confidentiality would be preferred.

### Making a suggestion

Typically these take the form: "It would be great if Lazysodium implemented feature X." 

If you are suggesting a feature, please make sure it's within the scope of what Lazysodium actually does - which is to wrap Java functions around the native C functions provided by Libsodium.

## Code contributions

If you want to contribute code, you first have to understand how Lazysodium works.

### Lazysodium and JNA

Lazysodium uses JNA with Direct Mapping to access native libraries. This means that you can write the native functions in Java without having to use JNI and Swig.

### Adding new functions

Let's say you've found a function in Libsodium that does not exist in Lazysodium and you really want it.
