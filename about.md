# About

## Why Lazysodium?

The problem with current cryptography libraries is that they can be one of 4 things: difficult to use, poorly documented, out of date or poorly architected.

So we built Lazysodium to make it **absolutely effortless** to get started with cryptography. We picked [Libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium) `1.0.16` as our underlying C library. Libsodium is an immensely powerful, well-tested and well-audited cryptography library that we found was perfect for securing all types of things.

## Supported languages

Currently Lazysodium only supports [Android](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-android) and [Java](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-java). You can also drop Lazysodium in Kotlin projects via [Lazysodium for Java](https://github.com/terl/lazysodium-java).
