# FAQ

## Why should I use Lazysodium?

We get it. You've tried a million other cryptography libraries and you're tired of performing mental gymnastics just to get something, anything working. We've done the work for you. We've compiled and wrapped the native libraries inside this project so you don't have to. Plus, we've designed our library in such a way that just makes it infinitely easier to work with.

## Why is this project called Lazysodium?

We wanted developers to have an effortless experience using cryptography. Every cryptography library we came across for Java and Android was plagued with inconsistencies and outdatedness. We thought, "Someone should do something about this...". So we did.

## Why create both Lazysodium for Java and Lazysodium for Android? Aren't they the same?

Even though you can code in Java on Android, it does not mean that Android conforms to Java's semantics surrounding the build and packaging phases. For example, Java packages files as a `jar` and Android packages files as an `aar`. This is so that you can include `res` files in your Android projects. This is why we have both Lazysodium for Android and Lazysodium for Java even if the former is just a wrapper around the latter.

## Who funds Lazysodium?

You can verify that a file was from us by performing the command:

```bash
# The general format is gpg --verify signature signedFile, for example:
$ gpg --verify lazysodium-java-2.3.0.jar.asc lazysodium-java-2.3.0.jar
```

Which should output:

```text
gpg: Signature made Tue  5 Jun 01:33:36 2018 BST
gpg:                using EDDSA key D1A9234F12141C2808B3E6015FCBE4222D2C66D7
gpg: Good signature from "Terl Tech Ltd <hello@terl.co>" [ultimate]
